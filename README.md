Frontend and server need env variables which are provided via *.env* files

VAPID keys need to be generated by executing **./server/node_modules/.bin/web-push generate-vapid-keys**. Create **.env** file to both *frontend* and *server* directories. Paste VAPID keys according to the **.env.template** file in each directory.

Once the client has push notifications enabled, it can receive push messages through the server, which you can send like this:
```console
curl -X POST localhost:5000/push -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"message here"}'
```
